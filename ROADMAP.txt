# Download Manager Implementation Roadmap

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Foundation Phase** (Setting up the project structure)
   - Create the directory structure as outlined in the architecture
   - Set up basic CLI using Cobra
   - Implement configuration management with Viper
   - Create logging system
   - Set up error handling patterns

2. **Core Components Phase** (Building the essential functionality)
   - Download Engine:
     - Implement basic download functionality
     - Add support for different protocols (HTTP/HTTPS first, then FTP)
     - Implement pause/resume functionality
     - Add retry mechanism
     - Implement progress tracking

   - Queue System:
     - Design queue data structures
     - Implement basic queue operations (add, remove, pause, resume)
     - Add multiple queue support
     - Implement queue prioritization
     - Add queue-specific settings

   - Speed Control:
     - Implement bandwidth monitoring
     - Add global speed limiting
     - Implement per-queue speed limits
     - Add per-download speed limits

3. **TUI Phase** (Creating the user interface)
   - Set up basic TUI framework with Bubbletea
   - Create main layout and navigation
   - Implement these views:
     - Dashboard view
     - Queue management view
     - Download progress view
     - Settings view
   - Add interactive controls
   - Implement real-time updates

4. **Scheduler Phase** (Adding time-based features)
   - Implement basic scheduling system
   - Add time-based download triggers
   - Create bandwidth scheduling
   - Implement queue scheduling
   - Add priority-based scheduling

5. **Integration Phase** (Putting it all together)
   - Integrate all components
   - Implement state management
   - Add persistence layer
   - Create configuration file handling

6. **Polish Phase** (Finalizing the application)
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement proper logging
   - Add unit tests
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation
   - User guide

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Data Storage**
   - How to persist queue information
   - Where to store configuration
   - How to handle download history

2. **Concurrency Model**
   - How to manage multiple downloads
   - How to handle queue processing
   - How to manage system resources

3. **Protocol Support**
   - Which protocols to support initially
   - How to implement protocol handlers
   - How to handle authentication

4. **User Interface**
   - Layout design
   - Navigation structure
   - Progress visualization
   - Interactive elements
